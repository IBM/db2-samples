/*
 * Current coordinator activity by status and whether the query bypassed the adaptive workload manager
 * 
 * EXECUTING - queries are currently processing a request in the database engine. 
 * IDLE - query is blocked on the client (i.e. waiting for the next client request). 
 * QUEUED â€“ query is waiting for resources so that they can be admitted. 
 * 
 * Two counts are reported per state for this query; the total number of activities and the number that bypassed admission control. 
 * 
 * Bypassed activities do not directly cause queuing.
