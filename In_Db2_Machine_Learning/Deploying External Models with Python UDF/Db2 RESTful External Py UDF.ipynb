    "This notebook provides examples of creating REST services that allow machine learning models hosted in Db2 as external User Defined Functions to be called as REST services.  Frequently developers will prefer to call other services with a REST API rather than importing Db2 libraries and writing SQL.  These examples are for applications that need to get an on line prediction for a single record.  This is different than the example on which this notebook is based as that example does a batch of predicitons on a set of inputs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook addresses two use cases:\n",
    "- The application has the set of features to be evaluated\n",
    "- The features to be evaluated are in a table in Db2\n",
    "\n",
    "The example for the first use case allows the applicaiton to pass the many features as one input parameter in the form of a JSON document.  It uses the Db2 JSON_Table function to extract the column values to input to the UDF.  This is much easier than having a bunch of input parameters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The example for the second use case has the service getting the features from a row in a table already in the database.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After each service is created, it is executed using he authorities of the service_user role.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Db2 RESTful Endpoint Get Token Notebook\" notebook is called to provide authentication tokens for the \" service admin\" and \"service user\" users.  The notebook expects the \"usertype\" variable to be set and returns the \"token\" string containing the authentication token. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each endpoint is associated with a single UDF call. Authenticated users of web, mobile, or cloud applications can use these REST endpoints from any REST HTTP client without having to install any Db2 drivers.\n",
