This repository contains notebooks and datasets that will allow Db2 customers to use in-Db2 machine learning functionality.

This repository contains the following example use-cases:
- Building ML Models with Db2: Build machine learning models entirely in-database with IBM Db2's in-database machine learning capabilities
- Deploying External Models with Python UDFs: Export and deploy an externally trained model in IBM Db2 with Python UDFs
