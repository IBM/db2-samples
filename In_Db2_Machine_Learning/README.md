This repository contains notebooks and datasets that will allow Db2 customers to use in-Db2 machine learning functionality.

This repository contains the following example use-cases:
- **Building ML Models with Db2**: Build machine learning models entirely in-database with IBM Db2's in-database machine learning capabilities
- **Building a Scoring Pipeline with Db2**: Use in-Db2 machine learning functionality for single row scoring inside the database
- **Deploying External Models with Python UDF**: Use Python UDFs to deploy and call externally trained models in Db2
- **In-Db2 Scoring with a Cloud Pak for Data Trained ML Pipeline**: Deploy a machine learning pipeline train on IBM Cloud Pak for Data to Db2 for in-database scoring
