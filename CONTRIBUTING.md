## Contributing In General

Our project welcomes external contributions. If you have an itch, please feel free to scratch it.

To contribute code or documentation, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/IBM/db2-samples/pulls).

A good way to familiarize yourself with the codebase and contribution process is to look for and tackle low-hanging fruit in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/IBM/db2-samples/issues).  Before embarking on a more ambitious contribution, please quickly [get in touch](#communication) with us.

**Note: We appreciate your effort, and simply want to avoid a situation where a contribution requires extensive rework (by you or by us), sits in backlog for a long time, or cannot be accepted at all!**

### Proposing new examples

If you would like to implement a new example, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/IBM/db2-samples/issues) before sending a pull request so the feature can be discussed. This is to avoid you wasting your valuable time working on a feature that the project Maintainers may not be interested in accepting into the code base.

### Fixing bugs

If you would like to fix a bug, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/IBM/db2-samples/issues) before sending a pull request so it can be tracked.

### Merge approval

The project Maintainers use review sign-off within GitHub on all changes to indicate acceptance. A change requires sign-off from at least one of the Maintainers of each component affected.

For a list of the Maintainers, see the [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) page.

## Legal

Each source file must include a license header for the Apache Software License 2.0. Using the SPDX format is the simplest approach.  e.g.

```
/*
Copyright <holder> All Rights Reserved.

SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
*/
```

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution.  We use the same approach - the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/DCO1.1.txt) - that the LinuxÂ® Kernel [community](https://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin)
uses to manage code contributions.

We simply ask that when submitting a patch for review, the developer must include a sign-off statement in the commit message which indicates that the submitter accepts the terms of the DCO.  Here is an example Signed-off-by line:

```
Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <Jane.Doe@example.com>
```

You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your local git repository using the following command:

```
git commit -s
```
