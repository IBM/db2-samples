    "Unlike connections that are established using the __ibm_db.connect()__ API, persistent connections created with the __ibm_db.pconnect()__ API are not closed with the __ibm_db.close()__ API. Instead, they are returned to a process-wide connection pool (when the __ibm_db.close()__ API is executed.) Then, the next time the __ibm_db.pconnect()__ API is called, the connection pool is searched for a matching connection and if one is found, it is returned to the application &mdash; new connections are not created unless there is no connection in the pool that meets the application's needs.<p>\n",

If a connection to a local, cataloged Db2 database is needed instead, just the alias for the database, as defined in the system database directory, must be supplied; values for the __*userID*__ and __*userPassword*__ parameters are optional. (If this API is called and just a local database alias is provided &mdash; for example, __conn = ibm_db.connect( 'SAMPLE', ' ', ' ' )__, &mdash; an attempt to establish a connection to the database will be made using the authorization ID and password for the current logged in Db2 instance user.)"
