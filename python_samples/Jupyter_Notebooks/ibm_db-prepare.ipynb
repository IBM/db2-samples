    "The __ibm_db.prepare()__ API is used to send an SQL statement to a Db2 server or database to have it prepared for execution &mdash; once an SQL statement has been prepared, it can be submitted for execution multiple times without having to be re-prepared. This benefits applications in two ways:<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Improved performance__: when an SQL statement is prepared, the database server creates an optimized access plan for executing that statement. Subsequent executions of the prepared statement (using the __ibm_db.execute()__ or __ibm_db.execute_many()__ API) will reuse that access plan, eliminating the overhead of dynamically creating new access plans each time the statement is executed.<p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "* __Greater flexibility__: when an SQL statement is prepared, literal values hard-coded in the statement can be replaced with parameter markers &mdash; depicted by question mark (?) characters. An SQL statement can contain zero or more parameter markers, each representing a variable or value that is to be provided at run time. Values for parameter markers can be supplied via variables (using the __ibm_db.bind_param()__ API), or for input parameters only, in a tuple (if the __ibm_db.execute()__ API is used) or a tuple of tuples (if the __ibm_db.execute_many()__ API is used). Regardless of which method used, when the prepared statement is executed, the database server will check each input value supplied to ensure the appropriate data type is used.<p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "It is important to note that parameter markers are only allowed in certain places in an SQL statement. For example, they cannot be used to represent one or more columns in the result set reurned by a __SELECT__ statement, nor can they be used as the operand of a binary operator like the equal sign (=)."
