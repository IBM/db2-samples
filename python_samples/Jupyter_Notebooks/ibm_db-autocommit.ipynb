    "The __ibm_db.autocommit()__ API can be used to determine if a Db2 server or database connection (that was established by calling the __ibm_db.connect()__ or __ibm_db.pconnect()__ API) is configured for __AUTOCOMMIT__ behavior. It can also be used to turn __AUTOCOMMIT__ behavior for a Db2 server or database connection __OFF__ or __ON__.<br><br>__AUTOCOMMIT__ behavior controls when transactions performing SQL operations against a database are made permanent (committed) or are backed out (rolled back). If __AUTOCOMMIT__ behavior is turned __ON__, transactions are committed automatically, immediately after they are executed. (In other words, each SQL operation is treated as a single transaction and when the operation completes, changes made to the database are made permanent.) If __AUTOCOMMIT__ behavior is turned __OFF__, transactions must be manually terminated by executing either the __ibm_db.commit()__ or the __ibm_db.rollback()__ API."
