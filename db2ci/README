*               README for DB2CI Samples
*
* The <install_path>/sqllib/samples/db2ci directory contains this README file
* where <install_path> is the location of DB2 9.7 on your hard drive.
* The default location for <install_path> is $HOME.
*
* This README describes how to build and run DB2CI sample code for DB2 9.7.
* The DB2 9.7 sample code and build files for DB2CI are located in the
* following directory:
*
*    <install_path>/sqllib/samples/db2ci
*
* Copy the sample files from this directory to a working directory prior to
* building the sample programs. The sample program directories are typically
* read-only on most platforms and some samples produce output files that
* require write permissions on the directory.
*
* WARNING: Some of these samples may change your database or database manager
*          configuration.  Execute the samples against a test database
*          only, such as the DB2 SAMPLE database.
*
******************************************************************************
*
*               Prepare your DB2 sample development environment
*
* 1) Copy the files in <install_path>/sqllib/samples/db2ci/* to a working
*    directory and ensure that directory has write permission.
*
* 2) Start the Database Manager with the following command:
*      db2start
*
* 3) Create the sample database with the following command:
*      db2sampl
*
* 4) Connect to the database with the following command:
*      db2 connect to sample
*
* 5) To build Stored Procedures and User Defined Functions, ensure that you
*    have write permission on the <install_path>/sqllib/function directory.
*
* 6) cd to the directory containing the files copied in Step 1.

*
*                            Building DB2 Samples
*
* There are two ways to build DB2 samples: using a make utility or using the
* build files that are included with the DB2 sample programs.
*
*       o To build samples using the make utility see 'BUILDING SAMPLES
*         USING make UTILITY'.
*       o To build samples using the build files or when you do not have a
*         compatible make utility see 'BUILDING SAMPLES USING BUILD FILES'.
*
******************************************************************************
*
*                  *** BUILDING SAMPLES USING make UTILITY ***
*
* If you have a compatible make utility on your system, you can use
* the makefile provided. Such a make utility may be provided by another
* language compiler. Modify the PATH variable to include the directory
* containing the make utility.
*
* Depending on your environment, the makefile might have to be modified.
* For more details refer to the 'VARIABLES' section in the makefile.
*
* Execute the appropriate 'make' command in your working directory:
*
*       o make <prog_name> - builds the sample identified by <prog_name>
*                            Do not include the file extension for the
*                            program name.  E.g. make DbAuth
*                            For any dependencies refer to the individual
*                            sample.
*       o make all         - builds all supplied sample programs
*
******************************************************************************
*
*                   *** BUILDING SAMPLES USING BUILD FILES ***
*
* As an alternative to the makefile, the build files included with the DB2
* samples can be used to build the db2ci sample programs.
*
* Building Standalone Samples:
*       o bldapp     <prog_name>
*                    <prog_name> - the name of the sample program without
*                                  extension.
*         For any additional dependencies refer to the individual sample.
*
******************************************************************************
*
*              Common file Descriptions
*
* The following are the common files for DB2CI samples. For more
* information on these files, refer to the program source files.
*
******************************************************************************
*
* Common files
*
* README        - this file
* makefile      - makefile for all files
*
******************************************************************************
*
* Batch files
*
* bldapp        - Builds application programs
* bldmc         - Builds multi-connection application programs
* bldrtn        - Builds routines (stored procedures and UDFs)
* embprep       - Precompiles and binds embedded SQL programs
*
******************************************************************************
*
* Common Utility Function files
*
* utilci.c     - Utility functions used by DB2 CI samples.
* utilci.h     - Header file for utilci.c.
*
******************************************************************************
*
*               Samples Design
*
* Most of the DB2CI sample programs are organized to reflect an object-based
* design of the distinct levels of DB2. The level to which a sample belongs
* is indicated by a two character identifier at the beginning of the sample
* name. These levels show a hierarchical structure. The Installation image
* level is the top level of DB2. Below this level, an application can access
* different instances, an instance can have different databases, etc. Here
* are the DB2 levels demonstated by the CI samples:
*
* Identifier     DB2 Level
*
*     tb        Table Level.
*

*               CI Sample Descriptions
*
* The following are the CI sample files included with DB2. For more
* information on the sample programs, refer to the program source
* files.
