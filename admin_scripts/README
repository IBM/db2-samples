*               README for ADMIN SCRIPT CLP Samples
*
* The <install_path>/sqllib/samples/admin_scripts directory contains this
* README file where <install_path> is the location of DB2 9.7 on your hard
* drive.
* The default location for <install_path> is $HOME on Unix and
* C:\Program Files\IBM on Windows.
*
* This README describes how to run ADMIN SCRIPT CLP sample code for DB2 9.7.
* The DB2 9.7 sample code for CLP is located in the following directory:
*
*    <install_path>/sqllib/samples/admin_scripts
*
* Copy the sample files from this directory to a working directory prior to
* executing the sample programs. The sample program directories are typically
* read-only on most platforms and some samples produce output files that
* require write permissions on the directory.
*
* WARNING: Some of these samples may change your database or database manager
*          configuration.  Execute the samples against a test database
*          only, such as the DB2 SAMPLE database.
*
******************************************************************************
*
*               Prepare your DB2 sample development environment
*
* 1) Copy the files in <install_path>/sqllib/samples/admin_scripts/* to a
*    working directory and ensure that directory has write permission.
*
*    On windows platform, all samples should be run and built in a DB2
*    Command Window. The DB2 Command Window is needed to execute db2
*    specific commands. You can follow the step below to open
*    DB2 Command window.
*    From the Start Menu click Start --> Programs --> IBM DB2 -->
*    <DB2 copy name> --> Command Line Tools --> Command Window.
*
* 2) Start the Database Manager with the following command:
*      db2start
*
* 3) Create the sample database with the following command:
*      db2sampl
*
* 4) Connect to the database with the following command:
*      db2 connect to sample
*
* 5) cd to the directory containing the files copied in Step 1.
*

*
*             *** Executing ADMIN SCRIPT CLP Samples ***
*
* Use following command to execute ADMIN SCRIPT CLP samples:
*   db2 -vf <filename> -t
*           <filename> -- Name of the ADMIN SCRIPT CLP file(including
*                         the extension).
*
* Note: Use following command to execute the sample "truncate.db2"
*       db2 -td@ -vf truncate.db2
*           This sample has '@' as the delimiting character. If any character
*           other than default character(;) is used to delimit the statements,
*           use this command and replace '@' with the delimiting character.
*

*              Common file Descriptions
* 
* The following are the common files for ADMIN SCRIPT CLP samples. For more
* information on these files, refer to the program source files.
