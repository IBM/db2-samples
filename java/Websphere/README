*                    README for J2EE Samples
*
* The <install_path>/sqllib/samples/java/Websphere directory on UNIX and 
* <install_path>\sqllib\samples\java\Websphere directory on Windows contain this README file
* where <install_path> is the location of DB2 v9.5 on your hard drive.
* The default location for <install_path> is $HOME for UNIX
* and C:\Program Files\IBM for windows. 
*
* The DB2 v9.5 sample code for J2EE is located in the following directory :
* <install_path>/sqllib/samples/java/Websphere directory on Unix and
* <install_path>\sqllib\samples\java\Websphere directory on Windows.
*
* This README is organized into DIRECTORY ROADMAP, GETTING J2EE SAMPLES UP 
* AND RUNNING, J2EE SAMPLES DETAILS sections.
*
*******************************************************************************
*
*                        DIRECTORY ROADMAP
* 
* Websphere/ : This directory contains a the J2EE samples as a *.war or *.ear file
*
* For more details on the content of these directories, please refer to the
* the README file in the respective *.war or *.ear file. 
* 
********************************************************************************
*
*               GETTING J2EE SAMPLES UP AND RUNNING
*
* SETUP:
*
*   1) Copy the files from corresponding directory to a working 
*      directory and ensure that directory has write permission.
*
*   2) Start the database manager with the following command:
*      db2start
*
*   3) Create the sample database with the following command:
*      db2sampl
*
*   4) Change directory (CD) to the directory containing the files 
*      copied in step 1.
*
* BUILD AND RUN:
*    1. Extract the sample and modify the connection details and add the JDBC driver.
*    2. Deploy the sample in your Web server or Application server.     
*             
********************************************************************************
*
*                        DETAILS OF SAMPLES
* Usage Scenarios
*
*  1)  Samples: AccessEmployee.ear
*
*       Consider a user who needs to access the EMPLOYEE table by using Servlet
*       and EJB component.
*        
*       
*  2)  Samples: OptimisticLocking.war
*
*       The application is written to demonstrate the DB2 Optimistic Locking feature.
*       It describe that unlocked rows are unlikely to change before the update or delete operation. 
*       If the row does change, the update or delete will fail and the application logic handles such failures.
*
*       
*  3)  Samples: AIRLINE.war
*               airline.db2
*
*       The application is written to demonstrate the Currently committed property.
*       The cursor stability (CS) isolation level has been enhanced to allow for more concurrency. 
*       In the new implementation of CS, the behavior of a read operation waiting for a row to commit 
*       before returning a value is avoided, where possible. CS now returns the currently committed result, 
*       ignoring what might happen to an uncommitted operation. The overall result of this new behavior is a 
*       drastic reduction in lock wait and deadlock scenarios.
*    
*              
*  	  SETUP
*
*       I) Open DB2 command window and set up the airline database with the 
*          following command :
*
*            db2 -tvf airline.db2
*
*          This will setup the database for the application and configure the required variables.
*
*       II) Modify the CLASSPATH to include:
*
*          <install_path>\sqllib\java\db2jcc4.jar
*          where <install_path> is the location of DB2 9.7 on your hard drive. 
*          The default location for <install_path> is C:\Program Files\IBM
*
*       III) Deploy the application on WebSphere using the following steps :
*
*            i)  Open the administrative console
*           ii)  Browse for "Applications" on left navigation pane of the console
*          iii)  Click on "Install New Application"
*           iv)  Provide the "Local File System Full path"(Path of the .war file)
*            v)  Give the context root as "/AIRLINE" and click "Next"
*           vi)  Click "Next" in the "Select installation options window"
*          vii)  Select the checkbox of the AIRLINE application in "Map modules to server" window and click "Next"
*         viii)  Click on Finish in the ‘Summary" window
*           ix)  Click on "Save" after the application is installed 
*            x)  Click on Enterprise Applications on the left navigation pane of the console
*           xi)  Select the checkbox of the AIRLINE application and click on start.
*
*       RUNNING THE APPLICATION
*
*        I) Point your web browser to the following URL to run the Currently committed Sample
*           http://<host-name>:<port-no>/AIRLINE 
*
*       II) The Log In page will be displayed.
*           Provide the username, password, machine name (or the IP of the machine) and the 
*           port on which DB2 is installed on the machine.
