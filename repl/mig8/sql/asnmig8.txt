INTRODUCTION:
------------

   "Migrating DataPropagator Relational V1 to V5" contains vital information
spanning  some  78 pages, which busy users tend to read only after mistakes.
To prevent trial-and-error mistakes in migration to V8, we have  abbreviated
its  User's  Guide greatly.  Please study and understand the these few pages
before you migrate DB2 Replication to V8.  If this  documentation  does  not
suffice, please contact IBM.

   The general announcement of DB2 and UDB Replication V8 occurred on ${date
of  ga}.   The  installation  of  Replication V8 includes a 3-step migration
process to convert Replication control tables and CD tables from UDB V5,  V6
and  V7  formats to V8 format:  The first step creates new V8 control tables
in a backup schema and tablespace, both specified by the user.   The  second
step  backs  up  the existing Replication control tables and their dependent
views.  The third step -- the dangerous one -- substitutes  the  V8  control
tables  from  the  backup  schema  for  the  obsolete  control tables in the
Replication control schema, 'ASN'.   Migration  V8  runs  both  locally  and
remotely.


PORTENTS OF MIGRATION PROBLEMS:
-------- -- --------- --------

   Although published, the Replication control  tables  have  never  been  a
proper user interface;  manual updates invite inconsistency.  Therefore,

   1. If you manipulate Replication control tables other than through normal
operation  of  Capture,  Apply and IBM GUI administration tools, consult IBM
before attempting to migrate to V8.  Even if your  tables  appear  to  work,
they  may  differ  from specifications and the migration utility may produce
unpredictable results.

   2. If essential applications  depend  upon  Replication  control  tables,
consult  IBM  before attempting to migrate to V8.  Inevitably, migration can
disrupt an environment dependent on tables that change or even disappear.


THE THREE STEPS:
--- ----- -----

   Because a clean execution of migration is critical, any anomaly  detected
by migration causes immediate termination.


   Step 1 is a set of SQL scripts, one script per DB2 server.   The  step  1
scripts  reside in ${ *.sql repository }.  The user should browse the script
appropriate for the server database to be  migrated.   The  scripts  contain
                    ------
default backup schema and tablespace names, which the user can easily change
globally with his editor.  Designing backup schema and  tablespace  deserves
little time and effort, as the life expectancy of the backup schema is a few
hours.  The objective of step 1 is to create the new V8 tables in the backup
schema  and to create a single database-independent representation of system
catalogs.  Step 1 should run only once.  Its execution is system-dependent:

UDB client: db2 -tsf $DB2server.sql
            db2 bind asnmig8.bnd (to be included in $DB2server.sql)

OS/390 clients may use SPUFI to run the appropriate script.

AS/400 clients may use STRSQL ???

   Step 2, named asnmig8, is a portable C/C++ application containing  static
embedded  SQL.  Asnmig8 runs locally or remotely, requiring only a supported
DB2 client-server combination  functionally  UDB  V5  or  later.   Supported
operating systems include AIX, AS/400, OS/390, and Windows NT.

Migration uses  NLS  for  internationalization  of  messages.   The  default
NLSPATH  should suffice for migration installed via CD or the like. When the
NLS catalog differs from  convention,  an  export  will  be  required,  e.g.
"export NLSPATH=./%N.cat" on AIX.

   Migration of a subsystem or database requires two invocations of asnmig8,
one for the source server and one for the control server:

   asnmig8 db $DB on source  server using schema $SA for backup
      [ user $USER [ using $PASSWORD ] ]

   asnmig8 db $DB on control server using schema $SA for backup
      [ user $USER [ using $PASSWORD ] ]


The "control server" migration involves Replication tables having to do with
subscriptions  and  the  like,  while  a  "source server" migration involves
everything else.

Backup step 2 may be run any number of times before migration  step  3,  per
control or source migration.  After step 3, step 2 will not run again unless
preceded by fallback.

   Step 3, also named asnmig8 copies tables from the backup schema into  the
ASN schema and re-creates any views perturbed.

   asnmig8 db $DB on source  server using schema $SA for migration
      [ user $USER [ using $PASSWORD ] ]

   asnmig8 db $DB on control server using schema $SA for migration
      [ user $USER [ using $PASSWORD ] ]


FALLBACK
--------

   After you determine that you are ready to migrate, the migration  process
will successfully convert your Replication control tables to V8, and a valid
reason for "falling back" should not exist.   After  migration  to  V8,  the
fallback  mechanisms  are  limited  to (1) restoration of the control tables
saved in the backup schema and  (2)  restoration  of  entire  database  from
backup  media.   The reason for not providing an elaborate fallback facility
is that a single mistaken transaction can render programmatic fallback to  a
consistent state hopeless:  What data is corrupted?  How far replicated?  Is
it behind firewalls?  ...  A "Measure twice; cut once"  mentality  surpasses
any practicable fallback facility.

   Migration input is tables and view; migration output is tables and views.
If  the  input  tables  are valid, migration will produce valid output.  The
simplest guarantee of valid input  is  not  to  modify  Replication  control
tables  "by  hand."   Finally,  if  the  Replication  control tables have no
dependents other than Capture and Apply, then  your  migration  to  V8  will
succeed.

   asnmig8 db $DB on source  server using schema $SA for fallback
      [ user $USER [ using $PASSWORD ] ]

   asnmig8 db $DB on control server using schema $SA for fallback
      [ user $USER [ using $PASSWORD ] ]


MESSAGES
--------


ASN5000E asnmig8 for <action> is abnormally ending at <time>.

Explanation:  For reasons stated in preceding messages, migration is
abnormally ending.

User Response:  Study the preceding error messages and respond
accordingly.

--

ASN5001I A successful <action> is complete at <time>.

Explanation:  This migration step has completed successfully.

User Response:  Proceed according the user's guide.

--

ASN5002E SQL error at line < source line > in function "< function name >", SQLCODE == < sqlcode >, SQLSTATE == < sqlstate >:

Explanation:  The migration utility has detected an SQL error.
Any associated error message from DB2 follows immediately.

User Response:  Consult an appropriate DB2 message reference
for an explanation of the SQLCODE and SQLSTATE.
If the origin of the problem remains unclear, report the full
ASN5002E message to IBM.

--

ASN5003E Migration does not recognize the DB2 server.

Explanation:  The user has connected to an unsupported server.
Migration abends.

User Response:  Connect to only DB2/UDB, DB2/390 or DB2/400.

--

ASN5004E The prerequisite level of Capture has not run.

Explanation:  Migration can run only after execution of a
prerequisite service level of Capture.

User Response:  Install and run the prerequisite Capture fixpack with:

APAR IY15286 for UDB;
APAR IY15286 for DB2/390;
(Ellen will improve.)

--

ASN5005E The table serializing migration is missing.  Possible causes are incomplete Migration Step 1 or an incorrect backup schema 

Explanation:  Migration creates temporary tables in its backup schema.
The table which serializes migration execution is missing.

User Response:  The user has probably not run the step 1 script
for the server to be migrated.  That script will create the missing
table.

--

ASN5006E The migration status table has < r > rows, not 2.

Explanation:  Step 1 must run once and only once as documented,
with exit upon first error.  Else, the backup schema may be empty
or otherwise corrupted.

User Response:  If the status table has 0 rows, then run Step 1.
Otherwise, the status table indicates that Step 1 either failed to
complete or ran after completion and ignored SQL errors.
In the latter case, the user must drop all migration tables in
the backup schema and rerun the Step 1 script.  Migration tables
name all begin with 'IBMSN'.

--

ASN5007E The server or its version ( <version release> ) is not supported for migration.
                                             -

Explanation:  The server DB2 is running a version of DB2 not
supported for migration.

User Response:  Consult the Migration chapter in the
Replication User's Guide and Reference for a list of
DB2 hosts and versions supported for V8 Replication Migration.

--

ASN5008W The global row is missing.

Explanation:  The migration utility finds no global row in the register
table.  Therefore, The V8 restart table will be empty.

User Response:  Run capture as appropriate to insert the global row.

--

ASN5009E The column definitions of <schema1>.<table1> and <schema2>.<table2> differ.

Explanation:  A table and its backup are out of synch with
respect to column definitions.

User Response:  This message indicates manual interventions
that corrupted the asn or backup schema.  Contact IBM.

--

ASN5011I Migration of database '<database>' on <server> server using schema '<backup schema>' for <action> is starting at <time>.
                                                                                    -

Explanation:  This informative message just echoes the user's
migration invocation parameters to demonstrate communication.

User Response:  None.

--

ASN5012E After DDL (step 1), only <control source>-server backup (step 2) is valid.
                                          -

Explanation:  After running the Step 1 script or after falling back, the user
must run source or control migration for backup ( Step 2 ).

User Response:  See the migration chapter in the
Replication Guide and Reference for more information
about migrating a control or source server for backup.

--

ASN5013E After backup (step 2), only <control source>-server backup (step 2) and migration (step 3) are valid.
                                             -

Explanation:  After running control or source backup ( Step 2 ),
the user must either run backup again or migrate ( Step 3 ).

User Response:  Per the User's Guide, re-run Step 2 or run Step 3.
That is, backup again or migrate.

--

ASN5014E After migration (step 3), migration is complete, and only <control source >-server fallback is valid if desired.
                                                                           -

Explanation:  After running the migration utility on the control or
source server ( Step 3, "for migration" ), you can only proceed to the
fallback migration step (Step 4). From this step you can restore the control
tables saved earlier in the backup table space. Your only other alternative
is to restore the entire database from the backup media."

User Response:  Read the migration chapter in the
Replication Guide and Reference, and run a control or source server
migration utility for fallback -- if fallback is truly desired.  Normally
users do not run the migration utility for fallback.

--

ASN5015I asnmig8 usage:
asnmig8 database $DB on @(source|control) server using schema $SCHEMA for @(backup|migration|fallback)

Explanation:  This message presents migration utility invocation syntax when
the user prompts with no arguments, -h, or invalid arguments.

User Response:  Invoke the migration utility with the appropriate
parameters. Refer to the migration chapter in the
Replication Guide and Reference for more information.

--

ASN5016E <control source> server is already at version 8.x.
                 -

Explanation:  The migration utility has detected that the server database
already contains Replication V8 <control source> tables.
                                        -

User Response:  Verify the migration utility invocation parameters.

--

ASN5017E Migration has detected an empty "warm start" table.

Explanation:  Capture has not populated its warm start table.

User Response:  Start and stop Capture according to the Replication User's Guide.

--

ASN5018W SQL warning at line < line > in function < function >, SQLCODE == < sqlcode >, SQLSTATE == < sqlstate >:

Explanation:  The migration utility has detected an SQL warning.
Any associated warning message from DB2 follows immediately.

User Response:  Consult a DB2 message reference specific to your
environment for an explanation of the SQLCODE and SQLSTATE.
If the origin of the problem remains unclear, report the full
ASN5018W message to IBM.

--

ASN5019I The remote database <database> is running <remote db> <version>.
                                                          -

Explanation:  The migration utility has connected with the named federated database.

User Response:  None.

--

ASN5020E asnmig8.cat not found.

Explanation:  The migration utility can not open its message catalog.

User Response:  export NLSPATH appropriately, e.g. export NLSPATH=%N.cat
