<!-- Configuration file for automatic Runstats -->

<!--

The data access optimization maintenance activity automatically analyzes the data in tables to allow for applications to access the data as quickly as possible. 
Use this file to specify the tables for which DB2 should automatically collect statistics.

<!--  Tables to include for automatic statistics collection  -->

<!--
Specify which tables to include for automatic statistics collection FilterCondition. Statistics will be run for the list of tables from the result of the below query
    "select * from SYSCAT.TABLES".

You can specify which tables to exclude from the automatic statistics collection by using an expression similar to an SQL-style "where clause" in the FilterCondition.  For example, the following specifies that all tables with names that match the pattern 'EMP%' should be excluded from the statistics collection:


 <RunstatsTableScope>
   <FilterCondition>TABSCHEMA NOT LIKE 'EMP%' </FilterCondition>
 </RunstatsTableScope>

You can specify <FilterCondition/> to select all the tables.
For example, the following specifies that statistics should be collected for all tables, including system tables:

 <RunstatsTableScope>
   <FilterCondition/>
 </RunstatsTableScope>

For example, the following specifies that statistics should be collected for all tables except system tables:
 <RunstatsTableScope>
   <FilterCondition>TABNAME NOT LIKE 'SYS%' </FilterCondition>
 </RunstatsTableScope>

 <RunstatsTableScope>
  <FilterCondition/>
