<!--  Configuration file for automatic backup  -->

<!--

Use this file to configure DB2 to automatically backup your database using the following:

    1)  the backup options like  media onto which the backup and  mode of backup.
    2)  the frequency of automatic backups;

 -->

<DB2AutoBackupPolicy

<!--   Backup Options  -->
<!--
Specify the backup options 
   1)  the media onto which the backup will be stored; and

   2)  whether the automatic backup should be online or offline.

specify the type of media on which your backup image will be stored, and configure associated options. 
Valid types of media are:

   1)  DiskBackupTarget - backup to a file system;
   2)  TapeBackupTarget - backup to tape;
   3)  TSMBackupTarget - backup to Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM);
   4)  XBSABackupTarget - use Backup Services APIs (XBSA); and
   5)  VendorLibBackupTarget - backup to other vendor storage.

For each of these media types, there are different configuration details required:
DiskBackupTarget - The location needs to be specified using PathName. If you specify <PathName/> with empty values, the default DB2 backup location will be used.  To store the backup somewhere other than the default location, use PathName to specify a valid location on your file system.  For example, <PathName>c:/db1/bakcupimage</PathName> will store backup image in c:\db1\backupimage on your file system.  If you specify the backup should be stored on Disk, DB2 will automatically prune backup images from the directory specified.

TapeBackupTarget - specify PathName of tape media to store the backup images.The PathName can not be empty.
TSMBackupTarget - specify the session number for the TSM using numberOfSession.  Session numbers can range from 1 to 999.  If no session number is specified, a default value of 1 will be used. For Example,  <TSMBackupTarget numberOfSessions = "2" /> uses 2 session to store the backup images in TSM  server.

XBSABackupTarget - specify the session number for XBSA using numberOfSession.  Session numbers can range from 1 to 999.  If no session number is specified, a default value of 1 will be used.

VendorLibBackupTarget - specify the vender library using LibFileName, and arguments to the library using LibOptions. You must use a fully qualified file name with LibFileName.The LibFileName can not be empty.

Specify whether backup needs to be performed online or offline:

    1)  Online - Users can access the database during the backup. An online backup will run during the online maintenance window.

    2)  Offline - Users cannot access the database during the backup. An offline backup will run during offline maintenance window.

For example,the following would case automatic backup using  online mode and store the image in the default location in your file system.
 <BackupOptions mode="Online" > 
  <BackupTarget>
   <DiskBackupTarget >
     <PathName/>
   </DiskBackupTarget>
  </BackupTarget>
 </BackupOptions>

 -->

 <BackupOptions mode="Online" >
  <BackupTarget>
   <DiskBackupTarget>
     <PathName/>
   </DiskBackupTarget>

<!--
   <TapeBackupTarget>
      <PathName>M:/TAPE1/db2/bakcupimages</PathName>
   </TapeBackupTarget>
 -->

<!--
    <TSMBackupTarget numberOfSessions="1" />
 -->

<!--
    <XBSABackupTarget numberOfSessions="1" />
 -->
 
<!-- 
    <VendorLibBackupTarget>
      <LibFilename>c:/Drivers/temp</LibFilename>
      <LibOptions>t1</LibOptions>
    </VendorLibBackupTarget>
 -->

  </BackupTarget>
 </BackupOptions>

<!--  Frequency of automatic backups -->

<!--
Specify the criteria for determining backup frequency of automatic backups. Use the following 3  conditions to  determine the frequency:

  1. numberOfFullBackups ; and
  2. timeSinceLastBackup ; and
  3. logSpaceConsumedSinceLasBackup.

If any one of the above 3  conditions meet, then there will be a backup scheduled.

specify the minimum number of full backups.

specify timeSinceLastBackup ,maximum time between backups in terms of hours. For example 24 hours represents 1 day and 168 hours represents 1 week.

specify logspaceConsumedSinceLastBackup in  4 kilobytes. The value can be non negative  integer starting from 1.If the logspace value is 1 it means, if logspace consumed after last backup is greater than 4KB needs a backup now.

For example, the following case would take backup if any of the following condition are true
   number of full backup is less than 2 
   time since last backup is 2 weeks 
   log space consumed is greater than 1000 * 4 KB. 


 <BackupCriteria numberOfFullBackups="2" timeSinceLastBackup="336" logSpaceConsumedSinceLastBackup="1000" />

-->
 <BackupCriteria numberOfFullBackups="1" timeSinceLastBackup="168" logSpaceConsumedSinceLastBackup="6400" />

</DB2AutoBackupPolicy>
