<!-- Configuration file for Maintenance Window Specification  -->

<!--

Use this file to specify a maintenance window during which DB2 will perform automatic maintenance:
1) specify a period of low database activity for the online maintenance window; and
2) if required, specify a period in the database for the offline maintenance window.

<!-- Online Maintenance Window  -->

<!--
Specify when automatic jobs will be run 
1. during the specified window time.(During); or
2. any time apart from specified window time.(Outside)
Set the "Occurrence" attribute to "Outside" or "During" to select one of these options.

Window is specified using the following parameters:
1.startTime  
This is the time of day, expressed in 24 hour format, that the maintenance window should start.  For example, the following would cause the maintenance window to start at 11:00pm: startTime="23:00:00"

2.duration
This is the length of time, expressed in hours that the maintenance window should last.  For example, the following would cause the maintenance window to last 3 hours: duration="3" 

3. <DaysOfMonth> is the day or days on the month during which the maintenance window will occur.  You can specify one day, several days in a list separated by spaces, or all days. The values can range from  1 to 31 or from -1 to -31. Valus in the range from 1 to 31 represent days of month. Values  in the range from -1 to -31 are counting backwards from end of month. For example, -1 represent last day of month and -4 represent 4th last day of month. 
	
For example, the following would cause the maintenance window to occur on day 29 of the month: <DaysOfMonth>29</DaysOfMonth>.  The following would cause the maintenance window to occur on days 1 and 15 of the month:  <DaysOfMonth>1 15</DaysOfMonth>.  The following would case the maintenance window to occur every day of the month: <DaysOfMonth>All</DaysOfMonth>.  The following would case the maintenance window to occur on the last day of every month:<DaysOfMonth>-1</DaysOfMonth>

4. <DaysOfWeek> is the day or days of the Week when the maintenance window will occur.  You can specify one day, several days in a list separated by spaces, or all days. The names of the week days are expected to be abbreviated: Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri,Sat,Sun. For example, the following would cause the maintenance window to occur every Monday: <DaysOfWeek>Mon</DaysOfWeek>. The following would cause the maintenance window to occur every Tuesday and Friday:<DaysOfWeek>Tue Fri</DaysOfWeek>. The following would case the maintenance window to occur every day:<DaysOfWeek>All</DaysOfWeek>

5.<MonthsOfYear> is the month or months during which the maintenance window will occur.  You can specify one month, several months in a list separated by spaces, or all months.  The names of the months are expected to be abbreviated: Jan,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun,Jul,Aug, Sep,Oct,Nov,Dec.  For example, the following would cause the maintenance window to occur every January: <MonthsOfYear>Jan</MonthsOfYear>.  The following would cause the maintenance window to occur every January, April, July, and October: <MonthsOfYear>Jan Apr Jul Oct</MonthsOfYear>.  The following would case the maintenance window to occur every month: <MonthsOfYear>All</MonthsOfYear>
	
Note that the values specified for these options, <DaysOfMonth>, <DaysOfWeek>, <MonthsOfYear> are combined together logically to calculate the window.  For example, the following specifies that the window is on the first of the month:
  <DaysOfMonth>1</DaysOfMonth>
and the following specifies that the window is on the first of the month, only when that day is a Monday:
  <DaysOfWeek>Mon</DaysOfWeek>
  <DaysOfMonth>1</DaysOfMonth>

Here are some examples of a valid Occurrence attribute specifications:

The following causes the online maintenance to occur for 3 hours at the end of the first day of every month when ever falls on Monday:
 <OnlineWindow Occurrence="During" startTime="21:00:00" duration="3">
   <DaysOfWeek>Mon</DaysOfWeek>
   <DaysOfMonth>1</DaysOfMonth>
   <MonthsOfYear>All</MonthsOfYear>
 </OnlineWindow>

The following causes the online maintenance to occur for 5 hours starting at the end of the day, on the 1st, 15th and 2nd last day of July, October and December, fall on Monday or Friday.
 <OnlineWindow Occurrence="During" startTime="21:00:00" duration="5">
   <DaysOfWeek>Mon Fri</DaysOfWeek>
   <DaysOfMonth>1 15 -2</DaysOfMonth>
   <MonthsOfYear>Jul Oct Dec</MonthsOfYear>
 </OnlineWindow>

The following causes the online maintenance to occur for 3 hours at the beginning of the day, on the 2nd day,4th last day and last day of every months fall on Saturday or Sunday.
 <OnlineWindow Occurrence="During" startTime="00:00:00" duration="3">
   <DaysOfWeek>Sat Sun</DaysOfWeek>
   <DaysOfMonth>2 -4 -1</DaysOfMonth>
   <MonthsOfYear>All</MonthsOfYear>
 </OnlineWindow>
 -->
 <OnlineWindow Occurrence="During" startTime="00:00:00" duration="24">
   <DaysOfWeek>All</DaysOfWeek>
   <DaysOfMonth>All</DaysOfMonth>
   <MonthsOfYear>All</MonthsOfYear>
 </OnlineWindow>

<!--  Offline Maintenance Window -->

<!--

Optional:
Specify when offline automatic maintenance can occur in the Occurrence attribute.  
Specify the OfflineWindow using the same method as described above for the OnlineWindow.

 -->

<!--
 <OfflineWindow Occurrence="During" startTime="00:00:00" duration="24" >
   <DaysOfWeek>All</DaysOfWeek>
   <DaysOfMonth>All</DaysOfMonth>
   <MonthsOfYear>All</MonthsOfYear>
 </OfflineWindow>
 -->
