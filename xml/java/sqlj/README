*                    README for SQLj XML Samples 	
*
* For windows, the <install_path>\sqllib\samples\xml\java\sqlj directory
* contains this README file.
* For unix, <install_path>/sqllib/samples/xml/java/sqlj directory contain
* this README file.
* This README describes how to build and run sqlj sample code for DB2 9.7.
* The DB2 9.7 sqlj sample are located in the
* <install_path>\sqllib\samples\xml\java\sqlj directory for windows platform
* and <install_path>/sqllib/samples/xml/java/sqlj for unix based platforms.
* where <install_path> is the location of DB2 9.7 on your hard drive. The
* default location for <install_path> is C:\Program Files\IBM for windows
* and $HOME for unix based platform.
*
* Copy the files from this directory to your working directory prior to
* building the sample programs. The sample programs directory is
* typically read-only on most platforms and some samples produce output
* files that require write permissions on the directory.
*
* WARNINGS:
* 1. Some of these samples may change your database or database
* manager configuration.  Execute the samples against a test database
* only, such as the DB2 SAMPLE database.
*
*******************************************************************************
*
*           Prepare your DB2 sample development environment
*
*  1) Copy the files in <install_path>\sqllib\samples\xml\java\sqlj\* (for
*     windows platform) or <install_path>/sqllib/samples/xml/java/sqlj/*
*     (for UNIX based platform) to your working directory and ensure that
*     directory has write permission.
*
*  2) Modify the CLASSPATH.
*       For Windows include
*         <install_path>\sqllib\java\db2java.zip
*         <install_path>\sqllib\java\db2jcc.jar
*         <install_path>\sqllib\java\db2jcc_license_cu.jar
*         <install_path>\sqllib\java\jdk\lib
*         <install_path>\sqllib\lib
*         <install_path>\sqllib\function
*         <install_path>\sqllib\java\sqlj.zip
*
*       For UNIX based platform include
*         <install_path>/sqllib/java/db2java.zip
*         <install_path>/sqllib/java/db2jcc.jar
*         <install_path>/sqllib/java/db2jcc_license_cu.jar
*         <install_path>/sqllib/java/jdk/lib
*         <install_path>/sqllib/lib
*         <install_path>/sqllib/function
*         <install_path>/sqllib/java/sqlj.zip
*
*     Modify the PATH.
*       For Windows include
*         <install_path>\sqllib\java\<jdkDirName>\bin
*         <install_path>\sqllib\lib
*       where <jdkDirName> is the name of the java directory.
*
*       For UNIX include
*         <install_path>/sqllib/java/<jdkDirName>/bin
*         <install_path>/sqllib/lib
*       where <jdkDirName> is the name of the java directory.
*
*     Please make sure that JDK_PATH( db2
*     database manager  configuration parameter) is
*     pointing to the <install_path>\sqllib\java\<jdkDirName> for windows
*     and <install_path>/sqllib/java/<jdkDirName> for unix platform.
*
*     To see the dbm cfg parameter value, run the following from db2
*     command window (open the db2 command window from
*     Start -> Run -> db2cmd for windows platform) and look for the value
*     of JDK_PATH
*
*     db2 "get dbm cfg"
*
*  3). Enable tcpip:
*          db2set DB2COMM=tcpip
*          db2stop
*          db2start
*
*  4). By default, your database configuration parameter SVCENAME is
*      set to an available port_number. If it is not, update the database
*      configuration with an available port number using the following
*      command:
*      db2 update dbm cfg using SVCENAME <port_number>
*      where <port_number> is an available port_number.
*
*      After you have updated the database configuration manually, you have
*      to restart DB2 using the following commands:
*        db2 terminate
*        db2stop
*        db2start
*
*  5) Create the sample database with the following command:
*       db2sampl -xml
*
*  6) Connect to the database with the following command:
*      db2 "connect to sample"
*
*  7) cd to the directory containing the files copied in step 1.
*

*******************************************************************************
*
*                       Building DB2 Samples
*
*   There are two ways to build DB2 samples: using a nmake utility for windows
*   (make utility for unix based platform) or using the SQLj precompiler and
*   java compiler which comes along with the DB2 installation
*
*        o To build samples using the nmake utility for windows see
*          'BUILDING SAMPLES USING nmake UTILITY on WINDOWS'.
*        o To build samples using the make utility for unix see
*          'BUILDING SAMPLES USING make UTILITY on UNIX'.
*        o To build samples using the java compiler or when you do not
*          have a compatible nmake utility see 'BUILDING
*          SAMPLES USING SQLj PRECOMPILER AND JAVA COMPILER'.
*
* NOTE :
*
*    1. Some of the samples might need one or more data files at runtime.
*       some of the samples may also need setup script to be run before
*       running the sample.See the specific sample descriptions in
*       "File Descriptions" section for more details.
*
*
*    2. There are utility files available in this directory that are used
*       by these samples for error checking. Please make sure that these
*       files are present in you working directory. The information
*       about these files can be found in "File Descriptions" section of this
*       README.
*
*    3. Refer to the "File Descriptions" section in this README for
*       information on specific samples and any special considerations
*       relevant for each. The HEADER sections of these samples also provide
*       further details on each sample.

*
*           *** BUILDING SAMPLES USING nmake UTILITY on WINDOWS ***
*
*      If you have a compatible nmake utility on your system, you
*      can use the makefile provided. Such a nmake utility may be
*      provided by another language compiler.Modify the PATH
*      variable to include the directory containing the nmake
*      utility.
*
*      Depending on your environment, the makefile might have to be
*      modified.For more details refer to the 'VARIABLES' section
*      in the makefile.
*
*      Execute the appropriate 'nmake' command in your working
*      directory:
*
*         nmake <app_name> - Builds the program designated by <app_name>.
*
*         nmake all        - Builds all supplied sample programs
*
*         nmake clean      - Erases all intermediate files produced in the
*                            build process.
*
*         nmake cleanall   - Erases all files produced in the build process
*                            (all files except the original source files).
*
*******************************************************************************
*
*           *** BUILDING SAMPLES USING make UTILITY on UNIX ***
*
*      If you have a compatible make utility on your system, you
*      can use the makefile provided. Modify the PATH
*      variable to include the directory containing the make
*      utility.
*
*      Depending on your environment, the makefile might have to be
*      modified.For more details refer to the 'VARIABLES' section
*      in the makefile.
*
*      Execute the appropriate 'make' command in your working
*      directory:
*
*         make <app_name>  - Builds the program designated by <app_name>.
*
*         make all         - Builds all supplied sample programs
*
*         make clean       - Erases all intermediate files produced in the
*                            build process.
*
*         make cleanall    - Erases all files produced in the build process
*                            (all files except the original source files).
*
*******************************************************************************
*
*      *** BUILDING SAMPLES USING SQLj PRECOMPILER AND JAVA COMPILER ***
*
*     If you do not have a compatible make utility you can use
*     the SQLj precompiler and javac bytecode compiler to build SQLj
*     programs.
*
*     These samples use classes in Util.sqlj. Build the Util.sqlj program
*     using the following command.
*
*       bldsqlj Util
*
*     Note:
*             When you build SQLj programs with the build files, do not
*             include the file extension for the program name.
*
*     Like the SQLj makefile, the SQLj build files need to be
*     updated with a valid user ID, password and an available
*     port number.
*
*           bldsqlj - Builds an SQLj program. Here is the usage of
*                     this build file:
*
*           bldsqlj <prog_name> (requires hardcoding user ID and
*                                password in the bldsqlj.bat file)
*           bldsqlj <prog_name> <userid> <password>
*           bldsqlj <prog_name> <userid> <password> <server_name>
*           bldsqlj <prog_name> <userid> <password> <server_name>
*                               <port_number>
*           bldsqlj <prog_name> <userid> <password> <server_name>
*                   <port_number> <db_name>
*
*        Where,
*          o <prog_name>   - the name of the sample program without the
*                            .sqlj extension.
*          o <userid>      - user ID needed connect to the database.
*          o <password>    - password needed to connect to the
*                            database.
*          o <server_name> - server's name that you work with.
*          o <port_number> - an available port_number on the server.
*          o <db_name>     - the name of the database where the SQL
*                            package will be created. The default is
*                            "sample".
*
*    To build a individual sqlj sample, use the following command
*
*       sqlj <program name>.sqlj
*
*    To run the sample, use the following command
*
*       java <program name>
