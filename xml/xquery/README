*                    README for XML XQUERY Samples
*
* The <install_path>/sqllib/samples/xml/xquery directory on UNIX and
* <install_path>\sqllib\samples\xml\xquery directory on Windows contain this
* README file.
*     <install_path> is the location of DB2 9.7 on your hard drive.
* The default location for <install_path> is $HOME for UNIX
* and C:\Program Files\IBM for windows.
*
* The DB2 9.7 sample code for XQUERY is located in the following directory :
* <install_path>/sqllib/samples/xml/xquery directory on Unix and
* <install_path>\sqllib\samples\xml\xquery directory on Windows.
*
* This README is organized into DIRECTORY ROADMAP, GETTING XML SAMPLES UP
* AND RUNNING, XML SAMPLES DESIGN OVERVIEW and DETAILS OF SAMPLES sections.

*
*               GETTING XQUERY SAMPLES UP AND RUNNING
*
* WARNINGS
*  1. These steps gives an overview of building and running the samples.
*     Please refer to the README in corresponding directory for any specific
*     considerations.
*
* SETUP:
*
*   1) Copy the files from corresponding directory to a working
*      directory and ensure that directory has write permission.
*
*   2) On Windows platform, all samples should be run and built in DB2
*      Command Window.
*      The DB2 command window is needed to execute the db2 specific commands.
*      You can follow the step below to open DB2 command window.
*      From the Start Menu click Start --> Programs --> IBM DB2 -->
*      <DB2  copy name> --> Command Line Tools --> Command Window.
*
*   3) Start the database manager with the following command:
*      db2start
*
*   4) Create the sample database with the following command:
*      db2sampl -xml
*
*   5) Connect to the sample database with the following command:
*      db2 connect to sample
*
*   6) To build stored procedures and User defined functions,
*      ensure that you have write permission on the
*      <install_path>/sqllib/function directory on UNIX and
*      <install_path>\sqlib\function directory on WINDOWS.
*
*   7) Change directory (CD) to the directory containing the files
*      copied in step 1.
*
* BUILD AND RUN:
*    1. Some of the samples might need one or more of the data files at
*       runtime. The data files can be found in the xquery/data directory.
*       Please copy the data files to your working directory before running
*       the particular sample. For more details on the data files required
*       for a particular sample, please refer the header section of the
*       sample.
*
*  To compile these samples, build scripts are provided.
*  The README file in each directory containing the actual samples provides
*  the details about how to compile the samples using the build script.
*
*  Here is the brief overview :
*
* BUILD AND RUN :
*
*  To compile these samples, build scripts are provided.
*
*  C and CLI:
*
*  To create the executable for the sample:
*
*    bldapp <sample name>
*
*  where <sample name> is the name of the sample without any extension.
*
*  e.g. bldapp xpath
*
*  To run the sample:
*
*    xpath
*
*  SQLJ:
*
*  To create the class file:
*
*    bldsqlj <sample name> userid password [server name] [port name]
*
*  where <sample name> is the name of the sample without any extension.
*
*  To run the sample:
*
*    java <sample name>.class
*
*  where <sample name> is the name of the sample without any extension.
*
*  JDBC:
*
*  To create the class file:
*
*    javac <sample name>.java
*
*  where <sample name> is the name of the sample without any extension.
*
*  To run the sample file:
*
*    java <sample name>.class
*
*  where <sample name> is the name of the sample without any extension.

*
*         XQUERY SAMPLES: DEMONSTRATED FEATURES AND USAGE SCENARIOS
*
* To help provide valid, usable and comprehensive XML XQuery samples, the
* samples have been created to be based on specific usage scenarios or to
* demonstrate a particular feature or API.
*
* 1. Usage Scenarios
*
*        1. Some of the suppliers have extended the promotional price.
*           Find all the purchaseorder for these products and find out the
*           excess amount given by the customer. The financial department
*           needs the details of the customers so that amount can be returned
*           to customer. The result can be returned as an XML document.
*
*              Sample Name: xquery_xmlproc.*
*
* 2. Features
*
*       1. Path expressions - These samples demonstrate the path expression
*          with different kind of axis.
*
*	       Sample Name: xpath.*
*
*       2. Flwor exoression - These samples demonstrate XQuery FLWOR
*          expression.
*
*              Sample Name: flwor.*
*
*       3. SQL/XML function - These samples demonstrate how XQuery interacts
*          with SQL using SQL/XML functions.
*
*              Sample Name: sqlxquery.*
*              Sample Name: xqueryparam.* -- Shows how to pass parameters to
*                                            db2-fn:sqlquery function.
*              Sample Name: xupdate.* -- Demonstrates how to insert, delete, 
*                                        update, replace, and rename
*                                        one or more XML documents or document 
*                                        fragments using transform expressions.
*
*       4. Nested XQueries - These samples demonstrate the nesting of FLWOR
*          expression to restructure the XML data stored in the relation
*          table with XML columns.
*
*              Sample Name: xquery.*
*
*       5. XQuery Explain Support - This sample demonstrates the explain
*          supoort for SQL/XML and XQuery statements.
*
*              Sample Name: xquery_explain.db2
