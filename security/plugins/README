* README for Security Samples (all platforms)
*
* Last Update: May 2004
*
* These sample security plugins are designed to provide a simple
* implementation that you can customize to meet the specific requirements
* of your installation.  Security plugins can be used to replace the
* mechanisms that DB2 uses to authenticate users and obtain their
* group memberships.
*
* For information on developing security plugins, see the Application
* Development Guide.
*
* For the latest information on programming, compiling, and running DB2 
* applications (including security plugins), visit the DB2 application
* development website:

*
* QUICKSTART
*
* - Copy sqllib/samples/security/plugins/* to a working directory.
* - Examine the "makefile" and "bldplugin" script and update any
*   path information to reflect your specific installation.
* - Execute "make all" (or "nmake all" on Windows) to build the
*   three supported samples ("combined", "group_file", and
*   "gssapi_simple").
* - Notes, usage information, and installation instructions are
*   contained in the header of each "C" file.
*
*****************************************************************************
*
* Sample files:
*
* makefile
*   Platform specific makefile for compiling the three basic samples.
*
* bldplugin (bldplugin.bat on Windows)
*   Build script invoked from the makefile to handle compilation and
*   linking.
*
* combined.c
*    A single C file that implements both a simple userid/password
*    based authentication mechanism plus a file based group membership
*    lookup.  Userids, passwords, and groups are all maintained in an
*    instance specific text file.  This sample would be suitable as a
*    starting point for any userid/password based authentication scheme.
*    This sample can be built using the makefile.
*
* group_file.c
*    Implements a simple, file based group membership lookup.  A user's
*    group memberships are recorded in an instance specific text file.
*    Similar to the group lookup portion of "combined.c".
*    This sample can be built using the makefile.
*
* gssapi_simple.c
*    A highly simplified implementation of a GSS-API authentication
*    plugin.  User credentials consist of an ASCII userid and password,
*    which are validated against a simple text file on the server.
*    This plugin is suitable as the basis for any GSS-API based
*    authentication mechanism.
*    This sample can be built using the makefile.
*
* IBMkrb5.c
*    This file contains the source code for the IBM supplied Kerberos
*    authentication plugin on UNIX.  This code is designed to be used
*    with the IBM Network Authentication Services (NAS) toolkit, though
*    it should be possible to modify it to work with any other Kerberos
*    toolkit (such as the base MIT Kerberos 5).  
*
*    While this plugin cannot be built using the makefile, it is
*    supplied as an example of a "production ready" GSS-API based 
*    security plugin.  Although specific to Kerberos, it would be
*    an excellent starting point for any authentication scheme
*    based on a pre-existing GSS-API toolkit.
